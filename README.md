# GitLab2023
### *A lab focused on Git*

This lab focused on developing basic Git knowledge and practicing pulling and pushing code. 
Working in a pair, Spencer Godina was the Repo Owner and Jay Selzer was the Editing Teammate.

> While we had some technical difficulties, we eventually got through them all.

We learned how to make README files like this one on the GitHub website and how to make them locally.
Creating basic Java files and pushing them to the repository proved to be a simple workflow. 

> We ran into more problems with the basic java file than the git portion of this lab.

Looking deeper into merge conflicts provides perspective on how catastrophic they can be on a larger
scale. Branching is also a useful tool for adding new features and fixing bugs.
